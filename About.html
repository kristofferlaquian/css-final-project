        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Our journey started during a late-night hangout in college when a few friends and I were sharing snacks,
            memories, and more laughter than food. We joked about how the island needed something fun, something
            flavorful, something that brought people together the same way we were gathered around the table. That
            simple moment of just friends enjoying food after class, sparked the idea for Island CornDogs. What began as
            a playful conversation slowly grew into a mission to bring a fresh, exciting snack culture to our community.
            <br>
            <br>
            As we experimented with recipes, flavors, and techniques, we realized what made it special wasn’t just the
            food, it was the feeling. The same joy we had with our college friends is what we wanted every customer to
            experience. And that’s how Island CornDogs was born: out of friendship, creativity, and good food shared at
            the right moment.

        <h3>Brief History</h3>
        <p>Starting Island CornDogs wasn’t as easy as frying the first batch. With Saipan being a fairly small island,
            finding the perfect location felt like a treasure hunt. We searched through crowded streets, quiet corners,
            and even a few places that were “available” only in theory. Some spots were too small, others too expensive,
            and a few were being held together by sheer hope and duct tape.
            <br>
            <br>
            But every setback pushed us to look a little harder. Eventually, we found a cozy spot that felt like home —
            a place where locals and visitors could walk in, enjoy the smell of freshly cooked corndogs, and feel the
            warmth of our island community. That small, hard-earned location became the heart of our story and the
            beginning of something delicious.
